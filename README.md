# Danilo Donato ðŸ‘‹ 
### Data & AI Engineer 

My name is Danilo, but you can call me Dan.
<br>
Graduated in Systems Analysis and Development and a resident of the SÃ£o Paulo - Brazil. I have been working as a Data Engineer for four years. I am an enthusiast of new technologies and market trends in the tech industry.

My career in technology began when I was younger, as I loved spending time on the computer researching and learning things, as well as spending hours playing games. Today focus is to become a specialist in data engineering and start getting more involved with artificial intelligence so that I can become one of the best engineers in the world.

Here in this profile you will find insane and surprising codes, not only from Data Engineering, but other areas as well!
